WorldEdit API
=============
The WorldEdit API is composed of multiple modules, each of which is independent and can be used without the other. Each module is contained within a single file.

If needed, individual modules such as visualization.lua can be removed without affecting the rest of the program. The only file that cannot be removed is init.lua, which is necessary for the mod to run.

For more information, see the [README](README.md).

General
-------

### value = worldedit.version

Contains the current version of WorldEdit in a table of the form `{major=MAJOR_INTEGER, minor=MINOR_INTEGER}`, where `MAJOR_INTEGER` is the major version (the number before the period) as an integer, and `MINOR_INTEGER` is the minor version (the number after the period) as an integer. This is intended for version checking purposes.

### value = worldedit.version_string

Contains the current version of WorldEdit in the form of a string `"MAJOR_INTEGER.MINOR_INTEGER"`, where `MAJOR_INTEGER` is the major version (the number before the period) as an integer, and `MINOR_INTEGER` is the minor version (the number after the period) as an integer. This is intended for display purposes.
