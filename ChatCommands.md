Chat Commands
-------------
For more information, see the [README](README.md).

Many commands also have shorter names that can be typed faster. For example, if we wanted to use `//move ? 5`, we could instead type `//m ? 5`. All shortened names are listed below:

Enable or disable node inspection.

    //inspect on
    //inspect off
    //inspect

### `//reset`

Reset the region so that it is empty.

    //reset

### `//mark`

Show markers at the region positions.

    //mark

### `//unmark`

Hide markers if currently shown.

    //unmark

### `//pos1`

Set WorldEdit region position 1 to the player's location.

    //pos1

### `//pos2`

Set WorldEdit region position 2 to the player's location.

    //pos2

### `//p set/set1/set2/get`

Set WorldEdit region, WorldEdit position 1, or WorldEdit position 2 by
punching nodes, or print the current WorldEdit region.

    //p set
    //p set1
    //p set2
    //p get

### `//fixedpos set1/set2 <x> <y> <z>`

Set the WorldEdit region position 1 or 2 to the position (`<x>`, `<y>`, `<z>`).

Display the volume of the current WorldEdit region.

    //volume

### `//deleteblocks`

Delete the MapBlocks (16x16x16 units) that contain the selected region. This means that mapgen will be invoked for that area. As only whole MapBlocks get removed, the deleted area is usually larger than the selected one. Also, mapgen can trigger mechanisms like mud reflow or cavegen, which affects nodes (up to 112 nodes away) outside the MapBlock, so dont use this near buildings. Note that active entities are not part of a MapBlock and do not get deleted.

Valid values for `[rotation]` are 0, 90, 180 and 270.

    //mtschemplace a_tree 270
    //mtschemplace huge_base

### `//mtschemprob start/finish/get`

This mode can be left with `//mtschemprob finish`. `//mtschemprob get` will display the probabilities saved for the nodes.

    //mtschemprob get

### `//clearobjects`

Clears all objects within the WorldEdit region.

    //clearobjects
    
### `//shift x/y/z/?/up/down/left/right/front/back [+/-]<amount>`

Shifts the selection area by `[+|-]<amount>` without moving its contents.
The shifting axis can be absolute (`x/y/z`) or relative (`up/down/left/right/front/back`). 

		//shift left 5

### `//expand [+/-]x/y/z/?/up/down/left/right/front/back <amount> [reverse amount]`

Expands the selection by `<amount>` in the selected absolute or relative axis.
If specified, the selection can be expanded in the opposite direction over the same axis by `[reverse amount]`.

		//expand right 7 5
		
### `//contract [+/-]x/y/z/?/up/down/left/right/front/back <amount> [reverse amount]`

		//expand right 7 5
		
### `//outset [h/v] <amount>`

Expands the selection in all directions by `<amount>`. If specified,
the selection can be expanded horizontally in the x and z axes using `h`
or vertically in the y axis using `v`.

		//outset v 5
		
### `//inset [h/v] <amount>`

Contracts the selection in all directions by `<amount>`. If specified,
the selection can be contracted horizontally in the x and z axes using `h`
or vertically in the y axis using `v`.

		//inset h 5

### `//brush none/(<command> [parameters])`

Assigns the given `<command>` to the currently held brush item, it will be ran with the first pointed solid node (as determined via raycast) as
WorldEdit position 1 when using that specific brush item.
Passing `none` instead clears the command assigned to the currently held brush item.
Note that this functionality requires the `worldedit_brush` mod enabled.

		//brush cube 8 8 8 Cobblestone
		//brush spr 12 glass
		//brush none

### `//cubeapply <size>/(<sizex> <sizey> <sizez>) <command> [parameters]`

Selects a cube with side length of `<size>` around the WorldEdit position 1 and runs the given `<command>` on the newly selected region.
If `<sizex>`, `<sizey>` and `<sizez>` are given, they instead specify the length of the cuboid in X, Y, Z direction.
This is mostly useful for brushes since it allows commands such as `//replace` to be ran, but it can also be used standalone.

		//cubeapply 10 replaceinverse air default:water_source
		//brush cubeapply 15 drain
		//brush cubeapply 12 3 12 drain
		//brush cubeapply 1 deleteblocks
